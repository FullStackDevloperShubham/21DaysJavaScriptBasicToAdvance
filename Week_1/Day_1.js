Day 1 â€“ Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.

HTML structures the content.

CSS styles the content.

JavaScript adds behavior (e.g., clicks, animations, validations).

1. Console
What is the Console?
The console is a tool in your browser (usually opened with F12 or Right-click > Inspect > Console) that lets you:

See output from your code

Debug errors

Test small pieces of JavaScript

Logging Output

javascript

console.log("Hello, World!");

2. Comments
Comments are notes in the code that are ignored by JavaScript. They're useful for:

Explaining code

Temporarily disabling code

Single-line Comment

javascript

// This is a single-line comment
console.log("This runs"); // This is also a comment
Multi-line Comment

javascript

/*
This is a
multi-line comment
*/
console.log("This also runs");

3. Basic Syntax
Variables
javascript

let username = "Charlie";
const year = 2025;
var isActive = true; //avoid this syntax to avoid confusion
